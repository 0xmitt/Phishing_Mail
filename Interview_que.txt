nterview Questions — concise answers

1. What is phishing?
Phishing is a social-engineering attack where attackers send fraudulent messages (usually email) designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information (passwords, financial data) or installing malware.

2. How to identify a phishing email?
Look for mismatched sender domains, SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures, suspicious links or attachments, urgent language, poor grammar, unexpected requests for credentials, and header anomalies.

3. What is email spoofing?
Email spoofing is forging email headers so the message appears to come from a different sender (often a trusted brand) — commonly done by changing the display name, the From address, or manipulating Return-Path. Authentication failures (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) help detect spoofing.

4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
They can steal credentials, cause financial loss, install malware/ransomware, provide attackers with network access, and enable account takeover or identity theft.

5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
Check the full email address, inspect raw headers (Return-Path, Received chain), confirm SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, compare sending IP to known provider ranges, and contact the sender via an independent channel (official website/phone).

6. What tools can analyze email headers?
Online header analyzers, SPF/DKIM/DMARC checking tools, VirusTotal/URLScan for links, and enterprise SOC tools (PhishTool, MISP). Mail server logs and forensic tools are used in investigations.

7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
Do not interact; report them; quarantine/delete the message; change credentials and enable MFA if you clicked a link; scan endpoints; notify IT/security teams.

8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
They exploit human traits (fear, curiosity, urgency, helpfulness) by crafting believable stories (billing issues, password resets, prize notifications) and impersonating trusted sources to get victims to act without critical inspection.
